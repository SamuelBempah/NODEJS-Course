Understanding node.js and its definition
- Definition of node.js: JavaScript runtime environment
- Foundation concepts and terminology

Netscape released the Mosaic user interface in 1994 and later developed Netscape Navigator.
- The Mosaic user interface was released in 1994.
- Netscape Navigator was a more polished browser released by Netscape.
- Netscape created JavaScript in 1995 to address the lack of interactivity in web pages.

JavaScript fundamentally changed the user experience of the web
- Java was popular at the time
- Microsoft debuted their browser, Internet Explorer

JavaScript implementation differences made websites work well in only one browser
- JScript was an alternative to JavaScript that filled the same use case
- Developers faced difficulties making websites work well in both browsers

Ecma International is an industry association dedicated to the standardization of information and communication systems.
- Netscape wanted a standard specification that all browser vendors could conform to, to keep implementations consistent across browsers.
- For JavaScript, the standard is called Eggman 262 and the committee that works on ik1262 is called technical.

ECMAScript is the official standard language, while JavaScript is used in practice.
- Oracle owns the trademark for the term JavaScript.
- There have been multiple versions of ECMAScript released, with ES2015 (ES6) being a notable one.

JavaScript is a prerequisite for developing with JavaScript features
- Although ecmascript and JavaScript are technically not the same, the two words are often used interchangeably.
- Whenever you see the word ecmascript, you can think of it as JavaScript.

JavaScript is a language that implements ecmascript
- ecmascript is the specification for JavaScript
- JavaScript builds on top of ecmascript
- ecmascript is the language we are familiar with
- The next video will discuss Chrome's V8 engine

Summary for [Node.js Tutorial - 9 - Local Modules](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gWoKrwGui4)

Title: Node.js Tutorial - Working with Local Modules

Local modules are modules created and used in the application
- Index.js contains a function to find the sum of two numbers using an arrow function
- The function is called with 1 and 2 as arguments and the return value is assigned to the sum constant

Creating separate modules in Node.js for better code management.
- Splitting JavaScript programs into separate modules allows for easy code management as the application grows.
- We will learn how to create a separate module for the add function in the same Node.js folder by creating a new file called add.js.

Node.js modules are isolated by default
- Each file in Node.js is a module
- Node.js allows executing multiple files using 'node <filename>'

Node.js adopted the common.js standard for module structure and sharing.
- The require function is used to include the add module into index.js.
- The path to the module is passed in as a string using the require function.

Understanding the execution order of local modules in Node.js
- The 'required' function loads the add module into index.js and its code gets executed by the V8 engine
- Once ad.js module code has been executed, the remaining code in index.js is executed

Debug and run Node.js programs in debug mode.
- Place a breakpoint in index.js to start debugging.
- Use the run and debug button to start the program in debug mode.

Node.js can automatically append .js extension when requiring JavaScript files
- Control flow with modules can be observed using console logs
- Ignoring .js file extension is a common practice in Node.js

Loading and executing modules with require function
- The require function is used to load a module into another file
- It is possible to expose certain functionality from the module while keeping the rest private

- Defining constants within modules

Using modules to require and use in Node.js
- Illustrating how to copy and paste and make changes in a new module file
- Demonstrating the use of 'require' to include the created modules in the main file

Console log output contains the same constant for superhero
- When running 'node index', the console output is 'Batman' followed by 'Superman'.
- The constant being logged is 'superhero', resulting in the output of 'Batman' and 'Superman'.

Node.js modules have their own scope
- Node.js achieves module scope with immediately invoked function expression (IIFE)
- This is similar to the IIFE pattern in JavaScript

Defining functions in Node.js
- Functions are defined with parentheses and curly braces
- To immediately invoke a function, add parentheses at the end

Node.js uses function scope for modules
- Modules in Node.js have their own private scope, allowing for encapsulation of variables and functions
- Changing a value within one module will not affect the same value in other modules

Node.js provides module scope for encapsulation and reusability
- Node.js wraps module code with a function wrapper before execution
- This ensures proper encapsulation and prevents conflicts

Node.js modules are wrapped with an iffy for private scoping
- Private scoping of code prevents conflicts with variable or function names
- Consider subscribing to the channel for more tutorials

Summary for [Node.js Tutorial - 12 - Module Wrapper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce90lLhDI_Y)

Module Wrapper and Parameters in Node.js

Node.js modules are wrapped in an iffy to keep top level variables scoped to the module
- Modules in Node.js get wrapped in an iffy to prevent top level variables from becoming global
- The iffy that wraps every module contains five parameters that are important for the module's functioning

Parameters and Arguments in Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)
- Parameters can be added to each function in an IIFE, such as 'message' in this case.
- Arguments can be passed to the IIFE functions, and the output can be observed.

Understanding module wrapping in Node.js
- Module code wrapped in immediately invoked function expression
- Final code with parameters and wrapping each module code in IIFE with five parameters

Accessing require and module.exports in Node.js

Learning about module caching
- Module caching is an important concept in Node.js
- Creating and exporting a class instance in Node.js for caching

Using Module Caching in Node.js
- Loading modules using require and setting values
- Creating new instances and using module caching

Module caching in Node.js
- Node.js caches required modules for subsequent loading
- This can lead to unexpected results when working with instances of the same module

Module caching in Node.js helps in reusing loaded modules for better performance.
- When a module is loaded and cached, Node.js remembers it and reuses it when required again, improving performance.
- Module caching ensures that the same object is reused across different files, enhancing overall performance.

Understand how caching works
- Node.js uses caching to store required modules in memory for faster performance.
- The cache is updated when modules are required and can improve application performance.

Module caching in Node.js
- Instances of a module are cached in Node.js
- Updating property values reuses the cached instance

Node.js reuses cached modules to improve performance.
- Module caching allows Node.js to reuse already loaded modules instead of parsing them again for better performance.
- To create separate instances of a module, export the class itself instead of an instance, and then import and use the class in other files.

Demonstrating module caching in Node.js
- Shows how to pass and retrieve values using module caching
- Emphasizes the importance of correctly importing and exporting modules to avoid unexpected bugs

Summary for [Node.js Tutorial - 16 - ES Modules](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g98XlFOiXz0)

Title: Understanding ES Modules in Node.js

Node.js introduces ES modules as a new module system.
- Common.js treats each file as a module, where variables, functions, and classes are not accessible by default to other files.
- To export parts of code, module.exports object or the exports shortcut are used; for importing code, the require function is used.

ES Modules introduced a standardized module system in JavaScript
- Node.js previously defaulted to CommonJS but now supports ES modules
- ES modules became fully implemented in Node.js with version 14

ES modules use .mjs file extension
- ES modules use .mjs instead of .js for file extension
- We can export and import variables or functions using ES modules

Different patterns of using ES Modules in Node.js
- Second pattern: Exporting default on the same line as the arrow function
- Third pattern: Exporting multiple variables or functions

Exporting and importing objects with ES Modules
- ES2015 allows default export and named exports
- Can use shorthand for key-value pairs and destructuring in imports

ES modules support both default exports and named exports.
- Named exports require the variable or function name to match while importing.
- Default exports can be defined with the export keyword at the start of the function or variable.

Different ways to import and use ES Modules in Node.js
- Import with 'import * as math' to access all exports as an object and destructure specific functions
- Import with named exports using curly braces for specific functions, demonstrating destructuring and terminal output

ES Modules were introduced with ES2015 and Node.js provides stable support since version 14.
- With ES Modules, instead of module.exports, we use the export keyword. It can be default or named.
- Importing the exported variables or functions using the import keyword. The import name must be the same for named exports.

Summary for [Node.js Tutorial - 19 - Path Module](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p995SdRXw_E)

Title: Node.js Path Module - Working with Files and Directory Paths

Node.js provides built-in modules to help build applications.
- The path module is the first built-in module we are discussing.
- It provides utilities for working with files and directory paths, and can be imported using the require function.

Node.js provides convenience variables for file and directory names.
- The __filename variable represents the full path to the file index.js.
- The __dirname variable represents the full path to the folder where index.js is located.

Node.js path module methods
- The EXT name method retains the extension of the path.
- The parse method returns an object with significant properties of the path.

path.format, path.parse and path.isAbsolute methods in Node.js
- path.format is used to format a path object into a string.
- path.parse is used to parse a path string into an object.

Path Module in Node.js helps in path manipulation and normalization.
- Node.js path.join method normalizes the resulting path by removing any duplicate or unnecessary separators.
- Using forward slash for Mac and backslash for Windows in path manipulation.

The resolve method gives the absolute path by joining path segments.
- The resolve method takes path segments and returns an absolute path.
- The output of the resolve method is dependent on the arguments passed.

The path module manipulates file paths and names
- Using `path.join()` to add an absolute path to the current folder and join the arguments
- The result changes based on the presence of forward slashes and the sequence of path

The node protocol helps in clear identification and conflict avoidance for built-in modules.
- Node protocol makes it clear that the import is a node.js built-in module, which beginners may not always realize.
- It also makes the import identifier a valid absolute URL, and avoids conflicts for future node.js built-in modules.

Summary for [Node.js Tutorial - 20 - Callback Pattern](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z03tYranyWs)

Video Title: Understanding Node.js Callback Pattern in JavaScript

Understanding the Callback pattern in node.js
- Node.js uses the Callback pattern for asynchronous programming
- In JavaScript, functions are first class objects, allowing them to be passed as arguments and returned as values

Creating functions and passing functions as arguments
- Defining a function called greet which accepts a name parameter and logs a greeting
- Defining another function called greetVishwas which accepts another function as its argument and invokes it

Understanding the callback pattern in Node.js
- The concept of a function as an argument in a callback function
- How the greet function with name parameter works

Understanding callback functions and their importance.
- A higher order function accepts a callback function and calls that callback function passing in the name constant.
- A callback function is a function passed as an argument to another function and is needed for specific purposes which can be categorized into two.

Callbacks are executed immediately in synchronous callbacks
- Synchronous callbacks get executed immediately when the control goes inside the higher order function
- Callback functions passed to methods like sort, map, or filter define the logic for the higher order function to apply

Async callbacks are used to continue code execution after asynchronous operations
- Callbacks are used to delay the execution of a function until a particular time or event has occurred in the async world
- Most modules in node.js have an asynchronous nature to prevent blocking of execution

JavaScript executes Callback function only when event occurs.
- Callback function is delayed until the user clicks on the button
- Execution of Callback function is triggered by a specific event, like click event

Callback pattern delays function execution until data is loaded.
- Node.js popularizes callback style of programming.
- Callbacks allow delaying function execution until a specific time or event.

Summary for [Node.js Tutorial - 21 - Events Module](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Su0-Y9coU3s)

"Node.js Tutorial: Understanding the Events Module"

Events module in Node.js allows working with events and custom event handling
- Events module enables dispatching custom events and non-blocking response
- Events are similar to everyday life occurrences that we can respond to

Events in Node.js mimic day-to-day scenarios
- Order being placed is the event
- Baking a pizza is a response to that event

The Events module in Node.js encapsulates functionality to emit and respond to events.
- The require function is used to import the event emitter class from the events module.
- The events module returns a class called event emitter, which is encapsulating functionality to emit events and respond to events.

Register a listener for an event using the on method.
- The on method accepts two parameters: event name and listener.
- The listener is a callback function that gets executed when the corresponding event is emitted.

Using the events module to dispatch and respond to custom events.
- Emitting events and passing data to the listener.
- Automatically passing arguments to the listener function in node.js.

Event module in Node.js allows registering multiple listeners for the same event
- You can register multiple listeners for the same event using emitter.on() method
- Listeners can perform different actions based on the event parameters

Event-driven programming in Node.js delays function execution until a certain event occurs.
- Emitting an event allows us to do work before the event occurs in the system.
- The events module in Node.js is built-in and used to work with events.

The Events Module returns an event emitter class
- We can instantiate the class to create an emitter object
- We can register event listeners and emit events using the emitter object

Inheriting event-driven architecture using EventEmitter
- Extending classes in JavaScript to inherit functionality from another class
- Using EventEmitter to handle orders in a pizza shop using event-driven architecture

Inheriting from EventEmitter in Node.js
- Use 'extends' keyword to inherit from EventEmitter
- Class-based inheritance introduced in ES2015

Node.js uses 'this' keyword to refer to the emitted object instead of a separate emitter object.
- When emitting events, 'this' keyword is used with 'emit' to refer to the emitted object.
- Listeners can be attached to events using 'on' method in Node.js.

Creating a separate module for serving drinks
- Registering an event listener for serving drinks
- Creating a new class DrinkMachine with a method to serve drinks

Using events to tie together different modules without tightly coupling them.
- Creating a new instance of Drink Machine using require
- Using events to pass and receive orders and log statements

Summary for [Node.js Tutorials - 45 - I/O Queue]

Understanding the Execution Order in JavaScript

**:**

- **IO Queue (IOQ)**: This queue contains callback functions that are generally prompted by asynchronous methods from built-in modules.

- **Microtask Queue Execution**: Callbacks in the microtask queue are executed before those in the IOQ. The event loop helps visualize this execution order, where the microtask queue (often related to promises) takes precedence over the IOQ.

- **Event Loop and Callback Queues**: The event loop organizes callbacks in various queues. Callbacks in the timer queue are executed before those in the IO queue. However, queuing a callback with zero delay in the timer queue can lead to inconsistent outputs.

- **Execution Order Issues**: The execution order of setTimeout with 0 milliseconds and IO asynchronous methods cannot be guaranteed. This inconsistency is often due to the minimum delay settings for timers in browsers like Google Chrome.

- **Node.js Timer Behavior**: In Node.js, when setting a timeout with a delay of 0 milliseconds, the minimum delay is set to 1 millisecond. Calculating intervals in milliseconds might cause a maximum value of 1 millisecond, requiring Node.js to determine if the timer has elapsed before the next iteration of the event loop.

- **Uncertainty in Execution Order**: There is uncertainty regarding the execution order between zero-millisecond timers and IO callbacks, especially when the CPU is busy. Timer queue callbacks execute before IO callbacks.

- **Different Callback Types in Node.js**: Callbacks can be added to the next tick queue, promise queue, or timeout queue. A for loop can be used to ensure that timer callbacks execute after the timer concludes.

- **JavaScript's Single-threaded Event Loop**: JavaScript has a single-threaded event loop designed to handle asynchronous operations. The priority order of the event loop queues is: promise queue, timer queue, and IO queue.

Summary for [Node.js Tutorial - 61 - Cluster Module](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHR-KmfRIsU)

Understanding the Node.js Cluster Module for Improved Performance and CPU Utilization in Applications.

Learn about Node.js's cluster module for improved performance.
- Node.js is single-threaded, limiting performance on CPU-intensive tasks across multiple cores.
- The cluster module allows creation of child processes (workers) that share the same server port, enhancing application scalability.

Demonstrating a simple HTTP server with different response times.
- The HTTP server handles two routes: a quick home page response and a slow page simulating CPU-intensive tasks.
- The server listens on Port 8000 and logs a message when it's ready, demonstrating its functionality in a browser.

Node.js single-thread blocking causes slow response times.
- Loading the slow page blocks other requests, significantly delaying the home page's response time.
- Utilizing the cluster module can resolve blocking issues by allowing multiple threads to handle requests simultaneously.

The Cluster module manages worker processes in Node.js applications.
- The cluster master spawns new worker instances to handle requests but does not execute application code itself.
- Each worker has its own event loop and memory, allowing for efficient workload distribution without blocking incoming requests.

Master creates workers to handle requests using Node.js clustering.
- The master process is responsible for spawning worker processes using the 'fork' method from the cluster module.
- Workers execute the same code as in a non-clustered setup, allowing for concurrent request handling.

Using the Cluster module optimizes Node.js performance with multiple worker threads.
- Utilizing multiple workers allows concurrent handling of requests, improving response times for slow operations.
- Creating too many workers beyond CPU core limits can lead to overhead and decreased performance.

Utilize PM2 for optimal Node.js clustering on your machine.
- Determine the maximum number of worker processes by checking your CPU cores using OS module.
- PM2 simplifies cluster management, automatically optimizing the number of workers for performance.

Using PM2 to manage Node.js clustering for optimal performance.
- Run 'pm2 start cluster.js -i 0' to automatically select the best number of workers.
- Monitor worker status and manage them easily to enhance application performance without blocking requests.

Worker Threads module enables multi-threading in Node.js.
- Allows running multiple application threads in a single Node.js instance without process isolation.
- Is useful when separate V8 instances are not required, providing efficiency with shared memory and event loop.

Implementing two distinct routes in Node.js with performance considerations.
- A homepage route is defined alongside a slower route to demonstrate asynchronous handling.
- The variable 'J' is used to track iterations in a loop, influencing the response after processing.

Worker threads improve performance by handling slow tasks asynchronously.
- When multiple requests are made, the main page experiences delays as it waits for slow tasks to complete.
- The worker threads module allows these slow operations to run in parallel, enhancing overall application performance.

Introduction to using the Worker Threads module in Node.js.
- Destructuring the Worker Constructor allows for easier instantiation of worker threads.
- Creating a worker thread involves specifying a file path, which facilitates offloading long operations.

Sending data from worker threads to the main thread in Node.js.
- The worker threads module allows communication between worker threads and the main thread using the parent Port object.
- In the main thread, events can be listened to using the 'message' event to receive data sent from the worker.

Worker threads improve performance by preventing main thread blocking.
- Restarting the server demonstrates the non-blocking behavior of worker threads.
- Displaying the variable J shows communication between worker and main threads, enhancing efficiency.

Worker Threads enable parallel code execution outside the main thread.
- They are useful for tasks like resizing images, processing videos, or encrypting files that require heavy computation.
- Further exploration of the Worker Threads module is encouraged by reviewing the official documentation for advanced features.
